[![Rust](https://github.com/alvaro-cuesta/rustopals/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/alvaro-cuesta/rustopals/actions/workflows/rust.yml) [![Rust docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rust-docs-blue)](https://alvaro-cuesta.github.io/rustopals/rustopals/)

Solutions for [Cryptopals Crypto Challenges](https://cryptopals.com/)
implemented in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

The final product should be a library of cryptographic primitives (see
[documentation](https://alvaro-cuesta.github.io/rustopals/rustopals/)),
implementing as much crypto as possible (instead of using libraries). Code
should be as generic as possible. Usage of traits and generics instead of
concrete types is encouraged.

The challenges will serve only as integration tests cases: the actual library
code is not organized around sets. If you want to review a specific challenge,
find it under the [`/tests/`](/tests/) folder and explore the used functions.

This is **not** a crypto library _(don't roll your own crypto!)_ but it should
serve as a real-world exercise.

## Running

- Run all tests:

    ```sh
    cargo test
    ```

    You can also run tests only for specific sets/tests. E.g. for set 1, challenge 2:

    ```sh
    cargo test set1::challenge2
    ```

    Or run the documentation tests:

    ```sh
    cargo test --doc
    ```

- Generate and open documentation:

    ```sh
    cargo doc --open
    ```
